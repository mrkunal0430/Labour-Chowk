   ###  The idea behind the project is on this  
   ->   ELIMINATING THE NEED TO GO TO MARKET TO FIND A WORKER AND PROVIDING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO EARN 
      
      ->  No alternative platform
          There is no platform which can connect the worker directly to required customer.It may happen that a particular worker may not be available in 
          market for a specific work.It require lot of       
          searching not only resulting in waste of money but also time.

      ->  Lots of competition in market 
          here is usually lots of competition in labourchawk .Usually strong workers surpress the weak and does not allow them to present themselves when a 
          customer arrives.The weak workers gets obliged 
          to lower their rate to get a work

      ->  Not a proper rate in market
          As said worker usually lower their seeing the competition or may increase the rate seeing the scarcity. So what our platform does it brings 
          uniformity in prices. Each worker gets fixed price 
          based on the work they do.

      ->  Eliminates discrimination
          Since prices are fixed there is no question of discrimination based on gender , religion and caste .No community can dominate over other in 
          online mode. Usually it is seen that female worker get 
          paid low price compared to male worker

      ->  Poor outreach
          Usually it may happen that labour chawk may be far away from a customer so our platform reduces the distance and eliminates a cumbersome process
